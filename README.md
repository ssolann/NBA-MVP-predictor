# NBA-MVP-predictor
This project uses historical statistics of NBA players from the last 30 years to predict the MVP for the 2022-2023 season. A machine learning model trained using linear regression was developed using data collected from various online sources. The data was scraped using technologies such as Beautifulsoup and Selenium, with HTML elements and Python used in the process. Data cleaning was a crucial part of the process to ensure that the data used for training the model was accurate and reliable. The model is a tool for NBA fans to make informed predictions and can be further improved with updated data. With its strong foundation in data and machine learning, this MVP predictor offers a unique and accurate way to predict the winner of the award.
